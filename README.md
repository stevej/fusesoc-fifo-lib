Test for devcontainer and github actions for fusesoc and associated tools. Ideally we'd be able to run cocotb tests, old school testbenches, and formal tests in a single project.


I started with the tiny-tapeout devcontainer template and hacked away until it was fusesoc only. The initial fifo code came from my Tiny Tapeout 04 submission in 2023, a FTFW Fifo with Almost-Full and Almost-Empty features.
